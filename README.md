# AngularMaterialDemo
This project contains full crud operation using http services. I have used angular material to design ui. 
## How to use rest apis?
I have created apis with json-server. 
In a seperate integrated terminal run `npm run api` command to start a api server.
## Run angular dev server.
Run this command in a seperate terminal `ng s -o'

Enjoy 😁
